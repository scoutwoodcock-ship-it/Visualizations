# Visualizations

Visualization Explanation

I made my best attempts to represent as many elements of my original plan which was outlines in another part in this respotiroy. I attempted to add the elements of color shown throigh the deviationn from the set temperature.

I learned specifically more about the fake data generator. I feel like I put a lot of effort into making it into what I wanted, and it was a good balance between looking at examples and adapting to what fit my visualization most. I definitely got more experience with errors, and find myself understanding what to do more and more while I navigate them.

I could not think of how to add the element of humidity, I was origninally thinking of having it as a second graph and overlapping them, however I found that to be to advanced, and decided to leave it out.

I think if I could improve I would mess around with the vidualization a but more, as I spent quite a amount of time making the fake data generator. I would also like to add more elements too it, so that a broader picture could be seen.
