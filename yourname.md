Explanation of graph

heat graph, used to see trends in data, helpful in seeing multiple variables and seeing them in color

axis, x is time, y is temperature

colors

-   Temperature deviation is seen using two main dolors
-   Red and blue
-   Red is used when tenperature deviates from the set temperaturee by x amount of degrees above (as temp from set temp increases so doeas the darkness of the color, and this is true for below
  the deviation, turns into blue color getting increasingly darker as the temp decreases
-   Sunlight adn outside temp would be seen as seperate colors of yellow (sunlight) and green (outdoor temp), getting darker as it cools

color code
-   Seen next to the graph
-   Showing colors and their means for dertain darknesses

Question: Could we give the computer the coorelating temps with darness of color in a way where we could click ona color and it would tell us the apox. point (time, temp (of chosen element)?

Interaction of user: When data is collected, squares will become smaller as it zooms out. This allows for more lognm term visualization, while still being able to zoom in and see short term trends if needed.

Data used:
time
temperature (need to inclide set temperature as well, due to it being based on a scale of deviation from that temoerature)
Included factors like sun/presense of shades in the room can be seen with different colors on the map (deeper explanation seen above)

Question: Can we overlay two maps? Could be helpful in seeing trends of two different rooms and how they compare.
